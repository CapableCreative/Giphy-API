# Giphy-API
FSF Trilogy Vanderbilt 2019 Codecamp Homework 6 - Giphy API

This application leverages the Giphy API in the following ways:
- Search
- Limit = 5
- Rating < PG

The purpose of this assignment is to create a text input for users to enter search criteria. That input is then used to display related gifs by assigning the term to the button's data-term attribute. Additionally, searched terms appear as new buttons available to reload previous search criteria.

The biggest hurdle for me was making generated buttons work on.click. I solved this by using a recursive loop.
